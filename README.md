# CryptoClustering

In this challenge, youâ€™ll use your knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

1. Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame.
2. Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data.
3. Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis.
4. Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data.
5. Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data.
